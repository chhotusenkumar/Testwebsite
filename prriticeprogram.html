    <li>Narendra Damodardas Modi<b>[a] (born 17 September 1950)</b>[b] is an Indian politician who has served as the prime minister of India since 2014.
        <li>Modi was born and raised in Vadnagar in northeastern Gujarat, where he completed his secondary education. He was introduced to the RSS at the age of eight. At the age of 18, he was married to Jashodaben Modi, whom he abandoned soon after, only publicly acknowledging her four decades later when legally required to do so. Modi became a full-time worker for the RSS in Gujarat in 1971.
        <li>In the 2014 Indian general election, Modi led the BJP to a parliamentary majority, the first for a party since 1984. <i>His administration increased direct foreign investment</i>, and reduced spending on healthcare, education, and social-welfare programmes. Modi began a high-profile sanitation campaign, and weakened or abolished environmental and labour laws. His demonetisation of banknotes in 2016 and introduction of the Goods and Services Tax in 2017 sparked controversy.
        <li> <b>Goods and Services Tax in 2017 sparked controversy</b>. Modi's administration launched the 2019 Balakot airstrike against an alleged terrorist training camp in Pakistan. The airstrike failed,[16][17] but the action had nationalist appeal.[18] Modi's party won the 2019 general election which followed.[19] In its second term, his administration revoked the special status of Jammu and Kashmir,

       <h2>Early political career</h2>
       <ul>
        <li>
       <strong>In June 1975</strong>strong, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi declared a state of emergency in India that lasted until 1977. During this period, known as "the Emergency", many of her political opponents were jailed and opposition groups were banned.[92][93] Modi was appointed general secretary of the "Gujarat Lok Sangharsh Samiti", an RSS committee
       </li>
       </ul>
       <h3>Development projects</h>
      <ul>
        <li>As chief minister, Modi favoured privatisation and small government, which was at odds with the philosophy of the RSS, which is usually described as anti-privatisation and anti-globalisation. Modi's policies during his second term have been credited with reducing corruption in Gujarat. He established financial and technology parks in the state and during the 2007 Vibrant Gujarat summit, real-estate investment deals worth ₹6.6 trillion (equivalent to ₹20 trillion or US$230 billion in 2023) were signed.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>2014 Indian general election</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>In September 2013, Modi was named the BJP's candidate for prime minister ahead of the 2014 Lok Sabha election.[209][210] Several BJP leaders,[211] including BJP founding member L. K. Advani who cited concern with leaders who were "concerned with their personal agendas", expressed opposition to Modi's candidature.[212] Modi played a dominant role in the BJP's 2009 general election campaign.[213][214] Several people who voted for the BJP stated they would have voted for another party if Modi had not been the prime-ministerial candidate.[209][215][216] The focus on Modi as an individual was unusual for a BJP election campaign.[211][217] The election was described as a referendum on Narendra Mod</li>
